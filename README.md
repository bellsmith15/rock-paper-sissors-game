## FEATURES
The Scope Plane

Features planned:
Responsive Design - The game/site should function correctly on screen sizes such as Mobile devices, Tablets, Laptops and Desktops for User to access. 
Navigation elements should be contained within the game screen.
Audio elements should be clearly visible to the user so that they can toggle audio on / off whilst playing the game.


# The Structure Plane

User Story:
`As a user, I want a fun and simple game to play.`

Acceptance Criteria:
* It should be clear how to play the game.

Implementation:
* The layout of the foreground and background will make it clear for the user to follow the game as it plays. There will be a button to the rules of the game on the page so the user can easily learn how to play and access information about the game.

User Story:
`As a user, I want to know what the score is.`

Acceptance Criteria:
* It should be clear what both the user score and computer score is. This will let the user know if they are winning or not.

Implementation:
* There will be a scoreboard that will display the scores for both the Player and Computer. 

User Story:
`As a user, I want to know who won.`

Acceptance Criteria:

## WIREFRAMES
The Skeleton Plane
Wireframe mockups;
My initial designs for the game were created in Balsamiq, to show how the game would appear across differnt devices. MODALS examples

## DESIGN
The Surface Plane
Design:
I wanted to have some visuals for the user and decided to have a background for a christmas image and use the foreground to contain the game elements.

* Background Image:
I wanted to give my site a chrismas theme and sourced the background vector image from vecteezy.com website where it is free for download and use. (vecteezy_mountain-winter-view-christmas-tree-background_.jpg)

* Color Schemes:
To ensure that the colours used for different elements provided the required contrast ratio the colour codes were loaded into a contrast checker available at Contrast Grid.

<!-- PUT IN LINK TO CONTRAST GRID HERE
PUT IN JPEG of GRID colours used HERE -->

* Typography:
Google fonts was utilised to find a font that would be clean and clear for all users, whilst still conveying an element of fun. I eventually settled on a choice of Festive and Mountains of Christmas.

* Icons:
Font Awesome was used to create the hand icons for the game and audio buttons.


* Features:
The User can click on the Rules button that will open the modal with the instructions of how to play

The User having read the instructions can then play on the game screen and make their choice to play against the computer.

A display shows the current score for both players until the total amount of rounds has been played.

The end result is displayed showing whether the user or computer wins or loses the game. The display can be close then the game is ready for another play.

- Modals There are two modals available from the page, one for the rules of the game and one for the results.


Future Enhancements

* Leaderboard - It would be nice for a player to enter their name and that their scores against the computer could be recorded onto a Leaderboard.

* Snoweffect - I tried to have an animation of snow running

# DEPLOYMENT

* This Game was deployed using GitHub Pages with the following the steps:

1. Click on the `Settings` icon at the top of page in the navigation bar
2. Scroll down until you see `Github Pages`
3. There will be a message box saying "Check it out here" Click on the link to take you to the next page
4. Here you will be greated with a form, Choose the repository `Javascript_PP2`
5. Choose the branch in the drop down box, in this case `MAIN`
6. Choose the directory in the next drop down box, in this case `Root`
7. Then click `Save`
8. It may take a few moments for the game to publish, but once live, the box at the top of the page with the site name will turn green and have a `Green` tick to the left of the link to the live page
9. Another way to find the live page is to navigate to settings, on the left menu click on `pages` and this will get you to the same point.

* These commands were used for version control during project:

    * git add `example filename` - to add files before committing
    * git commit -m `"example message"` - to commit changes to the local repository
    * git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
    * git branch - to see which branch currently working on
    * git pull - to pull all code into main branch once the feature branch had been merged and deleted

Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
Select the pages link from the setting menu on the left hand side
Under the GitHub Pages from the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
