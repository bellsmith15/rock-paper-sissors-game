# PORTFOLIO PROJECT - 2

# ONE STOP CLOCK

## PURPOSE

## FINAL DESIGN

![Final project image home page](assets/testing/finaldesign.png)

## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

My initial idea for the project was to create a game that is simple to use and competitive. The game is for all ages and skill levels.
I chose to make the game quite bright and fun looking with yellows and blues.
I made the game for Mobile first so that is works on all screen sizes.

* The Features I wanted the game to have are:

    * To have simple to read rules.
    * Have a contrasting colour scheme (Light blue and Yellow with Dark-Grey text)
    * Have a simple layout with 3 clear buttons with corresponding colours 
    * Look fun with images, and be educational

Features planned:

The Structure Plane

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to play the game with a keyboard

Acceptance Criteria:
It should not be necessary for a user wishing to play with a keyboard to have to use another form of input. All actions within the site and during the game should be able to be accomplished using a keyboard.

Implementation:
The user will be able to navigate the site using only a keyboard. All elements will be individually selectable through the keyboard and standard keyboard controls.

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to use a screen reader to help me play the game

Acceptance Criteria:
No information about the game should rely on vision to be accessible.

Implementation:
All none text elements that need to be understood by the user will also include aria-labels to provide the information to screen readers.

Design:

Background Image:
I wanted to give my site a chrismas theme and sourced the background vector image from vecteezy.com website where it is free for download and use.

Typography:

Google fonts was utilised to find a font that would be clean and clear for all users, whilst still conveying an element of fun. I eventually settled on
