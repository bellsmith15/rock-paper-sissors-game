Features planned:

The Structure Plane

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to play the game with a keyboard

Acceptance Criteria:
It should not be necessary for a user wishing to play with a keyboard to have to use another form of input. All actions within the site and during the game should be able to be accomplished using a keyboard.

Implementation:
The user will be able to navigate the site using only a keyboard. All elements will be individually selectable through the keyboard and standard keyboard controls.

User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to use a screen reader to help me play the game

Acceptance Criteria:
No information about the game should rely on vision to be accessible.

Implementation:
All none text elements that need to be understood by the user will also include aria-labels to provide the information to screen readers.
